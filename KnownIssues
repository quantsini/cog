Font resize of playlist does not change file tree, and 
does not resize columns (needs a lower bound), currently
only resizes title column.

Code for seeking should be moved into the AudioPlayer,
so we can escape ugly event* functions (the problem is
that the AppController needs access to seeker functions
because of apple remote seeking incrementally)

Shuffle list is not reshuffled when shuffling reaches
start or end of it (in Repeat All mode)

Menu items do not transform into "Hide Spotlight Panel" and
"Hide File Drawer" when they are active.

I anticipate that status should be flag based so statuses are not mutually exclusive.

Issues with queueing the same song multiple times
