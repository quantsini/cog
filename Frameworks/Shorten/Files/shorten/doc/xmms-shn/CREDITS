Thanks goes to the XMMS development team, as version 0.x through 1.x of this
plugin were originally based on the Input/wav/wav.[ch] files from the XMMS
distribution.

Thanks also goes to Caleb Epstein for testing and reporting bugs, and for
providing .deb and .rpm packages.

Wayne Stielau provided specs and code that became the basis of the 2.x version
of this plugin.  Without his help, this version would have taken much longer to
write.

Thanks goes to scottv for reporting a crash-inducing bug, as well as providing
me a way to download the file that caused it for analysis.

Thanks goes to Daniel Robbins for reporting the truncated-scope bug.

Thanks goes to Paul Mather for reporting the m:ss.ff rounding bug in shntool
(which also affected xmms-shn), as well as providing a detailed analysis of the
problem which expedited its fix.

Thanks goes to Ari Pollak for reporting a crash that led to the discovery of a
race condition in the .shn unloading code.

Thanks to Alex Prestin for sending a byte-swap patch that fixed a problem where
all files would play back as static on his Ultra 10 and Ultra 30, as well as
providing a patch to load text files in the file information box, which became
the basis of the current implementation.

Thanks to Rhett Monteg Hollander for reporting a bug that prevented xmms-shn
from playing files encoded with alternate options, e.g. "-b1280 -p16 -m4".

Thanks to Peter Kunath for sending a one-line patch to fix a bug in shorten that
caused incorrect seek tables to be generated under certain conditions, as well
as for providing a way for xmms-shn to automatically detect this bug so that it
can disable seeking in affected files.

Finally, thanks goes to SoftSound for creating a great waveform encoder,
shorten, and especially for providing the source code to it.  Without the
source, there would be no seek-enabled versions of shorten, and no xmms-shn 2.x.
