LAMIP-0.0.3 SHORTEN decoder
---------------------------

This is a shorten decoder for lamip. SHORTEN has been a widely used lossless
codec. Since version 3 shorten has seeking support through seek tables (.skt).
They can also be merged into the shorten file (.shn). The code for this plugin
derives from the xmms shorten plugin version 2.4.0 written by Jason Jordan. 
Look at that homepage:

http://etree.org/shnutils/shorten/

I have redesigned the xmms-shn plugin for a libshorten decoding library. You
should be able to install libshorten as a standalone-lib and decode shorten
files through that library

Config options
--------------
- error_output_method: can be STDERR and DEVNULL... I think the names are 
self explanatory

- swap_bytes: If you have a big-endian machine, switch it on!

- verbose: It is for some verbose debugging messages in the integrated logging
facility of libshorten

- seek_tables_path: An absolute path to a directory which contains shorten seek-
tables

- relative_seek_tables_path: A relative path to directories which contain
shorten seek-tables


INSTALL
-------
run :
- autoreconf -vifs
